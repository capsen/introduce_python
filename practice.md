## Practice Workshop 2
1.  Convert Inch and cm

* Create a python file **InchCmConverter.py**
* 1 inch = 2.54 cm
* In your code you need use print() input() str() and float()

### Example Output
```bash
Welcome to Inch CM Converter
Please enter the value of Inch: 34
34 inch = 86.36 cm
```

2.  Calculate average
* Create a python file average.py allow user to find average number from a group of numbers
* You need let people enter the number again if user didn't enter a number
* To achieve this you need use a list, if else condition, while and for loops, isdecimal() print() input() str() float() methods

### Example Output
```bash
Please enter how many number you going to enter: d
The text you entered is not a number!

Please enter how many number you going to enter: 3
please enter a number: 23
please enter a number: 23
please enter a number: 18.9

The average number is 24.96666666667
```

3.  Calculate max, min, total, average
* Create a python file exercise3.py allow user to find max and min number and the index of that number, total and average number from a group of numbers
* You need let people enter the number again if user didn't enter a number
* To achieve this you need use a list, if else condition, while and for loops, isdecimal() print() input() str() float() methods. Please make sure all the number people entered is stored in a list.

### Example Output
```bash
Please enter how many number you going to enter: d
The text you entered is not a number!

Please enter how many number you going to enter: 3
please enter a number: 23
please enter a number: 23
please enter a number: 18.9

The max number is 23 and position at 0
The min number is 18.9 and position at 2
The total is 64.9
The average number is 24.96666666667
```

## Practice Workshop 4
1. Create a python file **powerball.py** to generate a number of random Powerball numbers. The output should be like below

   - You need create a function name picknumbers which will take two parameter **poolsize** and **ballnum**

   - To generate one set of power ball numbers you can call method print(picknumbers(35, 7), picknumbers(20, 1))

   - Tips: Please use list(range(start,end)) to generate a list of the numbers and then use random.shuffle() method to shuffle the numbers each time before pick a number

   - To achieve this you need use a list, while loops, print() input() list.append() list.pop() methods
