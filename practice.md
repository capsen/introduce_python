### Example Output
```bash
Please enter how many number you going to enter: d
The text you entered is not a number!

Please enter how many number you going to enter: 3
please enter a number: 23
please enter a number: 23
please enter a number: 18.9

The max number is 23 and position at 0
The min number is 18.9 and position at 2
The total is 64.9
The average number is 24.96666666667
